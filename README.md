# Simianer-railroad
The purpose of this project was learn the value and implementation of using the moment.js library and utilizing Firebase.
Moment js is a library I enjoyed using, the documentation made using it more intuitive, especially to those just starting.
For fun I made a clock using moment js.
With Firebase I created a blank database, properly placed the keys to access it, pushed from html input fields to it then used the
snapshot function to populate a dynamically created table and cells with the information and repsective inputs.
